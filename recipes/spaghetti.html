    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a pasta dish made with fatty cured pork, hard cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper. It is typical of
        the Lazio region of Italy. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century. The cheese
        used is usually pecorino romano. Some variations use Parmesan, Grana Padano, or a combination of cheeses.
        Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but bucatini or rigatoni are also used. While guanciale, a cured pork jowl,
        is traditional, some variations use pancetta, and lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.
    </p>
    <p>The pasta is cooked in boiling water salted only moderately, due to the saltiness of the cured meat and the hard
        cheese. The meat is briefly fried in a pan in its own fat. A mixture of raw eggs (or yolks), grated cheese, and
        a liberal amount of ground black pepper is combined with the hot pasta either in the pasta pot or in a serving
        dish or bain-marie, but away from direct heat, to avoid curdling the egg. The fried meat is then added and the
        mixture is tossed, creating a rich, creamy sauce with bits of meat spread throughout. Various shapes of pasta
        can be used, almost always dried durum wheat pasta.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally,
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
            Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until
            onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute
            more.</li>
        <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive
            oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large
            fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and
            pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
        <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>

    </ol>
