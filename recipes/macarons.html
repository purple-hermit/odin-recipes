    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A macaron or French macaroon ( MAK-ə-ROON) is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar,
        granulated sugar, almond meal, and often food colouring,</p>
    <p>Since the 19th century, a typical Parisian-style macaron has been a sandwich cookie filled with a ganache,
        buttercream or jam. As baked, the circular macaron displays a smooth, square-edged top, a ruffled
        circumference—referred to as the "crown" or "foot" (or "pied")—and a flat base. It is mildly moist and easily
        melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavours that range from traditional sweet such
        as raspberry or chocolate to savoury (as a foie gras).</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1.75 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until foamy. Add white sugar and
            beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.</li>
        <li>Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl; quickly fold almond mixture into egg
            whites, about 30 strokes.</li>
        <li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of
            batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak
            instead of flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.</li>
        <li>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a
            plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let piped
            cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven until set but not browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cookies cool completely before filling, about 30 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
